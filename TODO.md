# TODO

* Implement Verb-Item intent-specific error messages when the item is not present. Example: "get door" could respond "You cannot get the door." because there is actully a non-gettable door in the room.  "get porcupine" would basically respond with an error stating that there is no porcupine. much like spoons.
* Implement a generic intent that allows for quickly registering simple commands
